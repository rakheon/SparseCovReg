SparseCovReg Analysis
================

This GitHub repository contains the codes for reproducing the analysis in ''High-dimensional covariance regression with application to co-expression QTL detection''.

## code

This folder contains the codes for reproducing the analysis in Sections 4, 5 and the supplementary material of the paper (simulation studies and real data studies).

1.  simul.R: All results of simulation in the main manuscript (Section 5) can be reproduced by this file.
2.  simul_supp.R: All results of simulation in the supplementary materials (Section S9) can be reproduced by this file.
3.  simul_CV.R: Tuning parameters for simulation in the main manuscript (Section 5) can be selected by this file.

## data

This folder contains all the utilized data and output from both simulation and real data analyses.

1.  main: All the utilized data and output of simulation in the main manuscript (Section 5) are included in this folder.
2.  supp: All the utilized data and output of simulation in the supplementary materials (Section S9) are included in this folder.
